## What is saint?

saint is a not so powerful toolbox for skeleton-based action recognition.

## Why saint?

we don't like the exsisting solution, especialy some with a lot dependences and not stable api in the stable version.
so We decide to build our own.

In the same time, we hope it can be compatable for more open-source CV code.


## roadmap

- now - 7.15 under restructure to meet the requirements of MEAS
- 2024 became a more geniric solution for CV task
