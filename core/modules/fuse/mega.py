'''
The global pooling layer: The global pooling layer extracts the global features from the input tensor. 
                            This is done by taking the average of all the values in the tensor. The global features are then passed to the memory module.
The local pooling layer: The local pooling layer extracts the local features from the input tensor. 
                            This is done by taking the maximum value of a small window of the tensor. The local features are then passed to the aggregation module.
The memory module: The memory module stores the global features and allows the network to access them later. 
                    The memory module is a simple linear layer that takes the global features as input and outputs a set of features with the same size.
The aggregation module: The aggregation module aggregates the global and local features to produce the final output. 
                        The aggregation module is a simple linear layer that takes the global and local features as input and outputs a set of features with the same size.
